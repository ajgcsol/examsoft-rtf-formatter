# ExamSoft RTF Formatter - Docker Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Setup Complete!

We've successfully restructured the project for clean Docker deployment with these improvements:

### ✅ What We've Created

1. **Dedicated Streamlit App Directory**: `streamlit-app/`
   - Contains only the essential files needed for the Streamlit application
   - Clean separation from LibreOffice converter and other services
   - Optimized for containerization

2. **Streamlined Docker Configuration**:
   - `streamlit-app/Dockerfile` - Optimized for Streamlit app only
   - `streamlit-app/.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files
   - Security: runs as non-root user
   - Health checks included

3. **Updated Deployment Scripts**:
   - `deploy-streamlit-to-azure.sh` - Full deployment with resource creation
   - `quick-deploy-streamlit.sh` - Quick redeployment for code updates
   - Both scripts now use the clean `streamlit-app/` directory

### 📁 Clean Directory Structure

```

├── deploy-streamlit-to-azure.sh     # 🌊 Full Azure deployment
├── quick-deploy-streamlit.sh        # ⚡ Quick redeployment
├── Dockerfile                       # 📚 LibreOffice converter (separate)
└── ... (other project files)
```

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Full New Deployment
```bash
# Run this if you don't have existing Azure resources
./deploy-streamlit-to-azure.sh
```

#### Option 2: Quick Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Run this if you already have Azure Container Registry from LibreOffice setup
./quick-deploy-streamlit.sh
```

### 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Clean Separation**: LibreOffice and Streamlit apps are completely separate
✅ **Smaller Images**: Only contains what's needed for Streamlit
✅ **Better Security**: Dedicated container with minimal attack surface  
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns
✅ **Faster Builds**: Optimized Docker layers and caching
✅ **Production Ready**: Follows Docker best practices

### 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   # If you have existing Azure resources from LibreOffice setup:
   ./quick-deploy-streamlit.sh
   
   # If this is a fresh deployment:
   ./deploy-streamlit-to-azure.sh
   ```

2. **Access Your App**:
   - The deployment will provide a public URL like: `http://examsoft-streamlit.eastus.azurecontainer.io:8501`
   - No more Streamlit Cloud authentication issues!

3. **Configure Microsoft 365** (if needed):
   - Update `streamlit-app/examsoft_m365_config.py` with your tenant details
   - Redeploy with `./quick-deploy-streamlit.sh`

### 🌟 Why This Solves Your Streamlit Cloud Issues

- **No MSAL Compatibility Issues**: Pure Azure Container Instance deployment
- **Full Control**: You control the entire environment
- **Persistent Sessions**: No Streamlit Cloud session limitations
- **Custom Configuration**: Full control over authentication flows
- **Reliable Performance**: Dedicated Azure resources

### 💡 Cost Optimization

The Azure Container Instance for Streamlit will cost approximately:
- **CPU**: 1 vCPU = ~$35/month
- **Memory**: 2GB = ~$5/month  
- **Total**: ~$40/month for 24/7 availability

You can also configure it to auto-shutdown during off-hours to reduce costs.

Ready to deploy! 🚀
